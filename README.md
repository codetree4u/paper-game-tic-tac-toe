## Project Introduction - paper-game-tic-tac-toe.
In this project, we will create the paper game tic-tac-toe using a class object-based approach.

## Game Description
For those unfamiliar with the game, here's how it works:

Two players alternate turns attempting to complete a row, column, or diagonal using three O's or three X's in a grid of nine squares.

Game rules are:
* If a player decides to select X, the other player will take O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
* The first player to get 3 of their marks in a straight row wins.
* If all the 9 squares are full but none of the players can get 3 of their marks in a row, it's a draw.

## Project Description
Here's how our project works:

### Project Design

The game design be divided into three main categories:  

1- The tic-tac-toe Board  
2- Two Players  
3- Win and Draw Logic  

#### The tic-tac-toe Board

We will handle this task by using a list of 9 items, since a tic-tac-toe board contains 9 squares.  
Grids are identified by their position numbers.  As an example, position 8 refers to the bottom middle grid.
