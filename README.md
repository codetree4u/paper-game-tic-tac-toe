## Game Description
For those unfamiliar with the game, here's how it works:

Two players alternate turns attempting to complete a row, column, or diagonal using three O's or three X's in a grid of nine squares.

Game rules are:
* If a player decides to select X, the other player will take O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
* The first player to get 3 of their marks in a straight row wins.
* If all the 9 squares are full but none of the players can get 3 of their marks in a row, it's a draw.
